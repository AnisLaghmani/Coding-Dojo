//****A computer application needs to be able to identify if a written paragraph is written in First, Second, or Third Person 


//****Using comments, write out 1 strategy that could be used to solve the problem.


//****Using comments, create pseudocode (an informal but readable description of code that uses regular language to outline a solution) to apply one of the strategies to solve the problem.
//i think first we need an array that takes the paragraph and put every word in elements of array 
//second we need a for loop which crosses element (words of paragraph )of the array
//third conditions that count up every time that the word is equal i/we or you or he/she. more details:we need three counters 
//one counting i/we ,second one   counting (he/she) and the third counting (you).
//and finalyy the highest counter value can   identify in which person the paragraph is written



//Using comments, write a short paragraph that answers: What is the hardest part of problem-solving?
//the hardest part is the extraction of word from paragraph to array
